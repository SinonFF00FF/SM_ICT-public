idk what to write here

this very very very nice written script (without any bugs or stuff that breaks if you do not know exectlly how stuff works) can
- read/write snnc2 containers/files
- read img's that contain data
- write data into an img

tbh idk what to write here and I dont execpt that somebody will ever read this so
you need to read the really well written help texts I wrote for the fkt
and find stuff out by yourself 

P.S.  this is just half finished

P.S.2 May God have mercy with whoever has to read this abomination
